# Ogo gem â€” parse info from urls for different social network needs

## Information

Implementation of first verion of this gem based mostly on @huyha85's opengraph_parser
https://github.com/huyha85/opengraph_parser and its forks.

I prefer to make my own repo for this gem as origin repo is seemingly-abandoned and
I need more functionality than just opengraph (ogp.me) tags parsing.
